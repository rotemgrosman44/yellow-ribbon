Yellow Ribbon Awareness Animation
An animated particle system that forms the iconic yellow awareness ribbon shape, created as part of "The Way of Code" art collection.
Overview
This project transforms flowing particle animations into the recognizable yellow awareness ribbon symbol. The animation features:
* Authentic Ribbon Shape: Particles follow the exact path of the awareness ribbon with proper loops and crossing
* 3D Depth Mapping: Advanced depth system creates realistic layering where ribbon sections pass over/under each other
* Dynamic Movement: Smooth flowing animation that maintains the ribbon's iconic structure
* Bright Yellow Styling: Uses authentic yellow coloring (#FFD700) to match traditional awareness ribbons
Features
* 22,000 particles forming precise ribbon geometry
* Real-time depth-based rendering with proper occlusion
* Flowing animation that preserves ribbon structure
* Optimized performance at 20 FPS
* Responsive canvas rendering
Technical Details
Built with:
* React hooks for component management
* HTML5 Canvas for particle rendering
* Custom particle physics engine
* Mathematical ribbon path generation
* Depth-mapped 3D positioning
Installation & Usage
# This is a React component - integrate into your React project
import YellowRibbonSwirl from './YellowRibbonSwirl';


function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <YellowRibbonSwirl />
    </div>
  );
}


Customization
Key parameters you can adjust:
* PARTICLE_COUNT: Number of particles (default: 22000)
* FPS: Animation frame rate (default: 20)
* Ribbon dimensions and positioning
* Color values and opacity
* Animation speed and flow patterns
Art Collection
This piece is part of "The Way of Code" collection, exploring themes of:
* Awareness: The ribbon as a symbol of consciousness and support
* Flow: Continuous movement representing life's journey
* Unity: Individual particles forming a meaningful whole
* Balance: Harmony between structure and fluidity
Contributing
Feel free to fork this project and create your own variations. Some ideas:
* Different ribbon colors for various awareness causes
* Multiple ribbons interacting
* Interactive mouse controls
* Sound-reactive animations
